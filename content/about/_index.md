Did you know that the name "Sisk" actually has no origin at all?

Some people ask me where I got this name from. I simply made it up. There's no inspiration, no origin. It just came to mind, I found it easy to say and write, also to remember. So I thought: why not use the name "Sisk"?

I see that other names had some origin or inspiration, like Laravel or Flask. Others had no inspiration at all, like Active Server Pages Network Enabled Technologies, or better, ASP.NET.

Initially, Sisk emerged with the name "Redis Proxy" in some old prototypes. But this name was already being used by another project. To avoid confusion, I preferred to change the name as well.
